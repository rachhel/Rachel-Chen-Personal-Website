            <p> A final project as a Kode With Klossy Scholar, I wanted to create something that meant a lot to me.
                And, that was mental health. Many students have extremely busy schedules and push themselves to overwork. 
                Through Moodivity, people can be productive while focusing on their well-being. It helps these students plan out their weeks, 
                jot down to-do lists, and time their study sessions. It also incorporates self-care by adding breaks, motivation,
                 and serotonin pictures to boost users' moods </p>
